<h1><img height="64px" src="./kitsune.ico" width="64px"/> Kitsune Wrapper</h1>
Kitsune Wrapper  -  investigation into a simple modular wrapper for use with applications and games. 
Wrapper extensions and functionality registered and loaded during runtime initialization.
Hopefully keeping initial load time short and only inflating the wrapper as needed during runtime.
